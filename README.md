## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

One challenge I had to think about was how I wanted the routes to be setup, and what components I wanted rendered based on the specific route. Another interesting challenge was deciding when to simply pass in props vs. have a component fetch the data itself, and overall deciding how the data flow should look like in the application. I really enjoy thinking about these types of problems in web development.
